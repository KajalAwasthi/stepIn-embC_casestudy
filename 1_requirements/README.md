## Introduction
As automation is taking ovr greatly in each part of our lives, everyone is looking for ways to reduse human work. With this project one such approach is being implemented, which is the temperature monitoring and reporting to the user. Atmega328 microcontroller is used in this prject with various components such aas temperature sensor, switch, voltmeter, etc.

## Features
- It senses when the driver leaves the seat.
- As this happens, driver gets access to the heat sensor
- Low cost and user friendly

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
- User friendly
- Low cost
- Makes temperature access inside vehicles manual

### Weaknesses
- Applicable only at certain places

### Opportunities
- Both hot and cold temperatures can be controlled

### Threats
- Wrong connections might lead to failure of components

## 4W 1H
