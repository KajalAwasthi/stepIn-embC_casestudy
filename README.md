## Heat Control System

This project is based on the concepts of Enbedded C programming. In this project, a *Heat Control System* is being developed. This complete task is divided into 4 activities. It is used to control the system inside the vehicle. When the driver gets off the seat, the button sensor gets activated. AFter this, the user gets access to the heater and the temperature sensor continously monitors the temperature and sends the analog values to the microcontroller. It processes the input of the temperature sensor and through serial communication, outputs the temperature values.
